**Sponge** is a powerful and easy-to-use Go development framework. Its core philosophy is **"Definition is Code"**. It generates modular Go code by parsing `SQL`, `Protobuf`, and `JSON` files. These code modules can be flexibly combined to build various types of complete backend services.

Sponge provides a one-stop project development solution, covering code generation, development, testing, API documentation, and deployment. It helps developers easily build stable and reliable high-performance backend services (including RESTful API, gRPC, HTTP+gRPC, gRPC Gateway, etc.) in a "low-code" manner, significantly improving the efficiency and quality of project development.

<br>

### Why Choose Sponge?

- **Extremely High Development Efficiency**: Automatically generates CRUD APIs, project scaffolding, and glue code (non-business code), completely solving the problem of extensive repetitive work in traditional development processes.
- **Out-of-the-Box**: Covers the entire development lifecycle (generate → develop → test → deploy → monitor), avoiding a fragmented toolchain.
- **Standardized Best Practices**: Based on mature solutions from the Go community (Gin/gRPC/Protobuf, etc.), eliminating the hassle of technology selection.
- **Minimal Learning Curve**: Get started quickly and focus on business logic through code generation and clear examples.
- **Ideal for Team Collaboration**: Unified project structure improves code maintainability.
- **AI Collaboration**: Based on Sponge's standardized directory and file structure, it intelligently generates business logic code, significantly reducing manual coding and improving development efficiency and code consistency.

<br>

### Key Features

<details>
<summary> <b>One-Click Generation of Complete Backend Service Code.</b> </summary>

> For `Web`, `gRPC`, or `HTTP+gRPC` services that only require `CRUD APIs`, there is no need to write any `Go` code. Simply connect to a database (such as `MySQL`, `MongoDB`, `PostgreSQL`, `SQLite`), and you can generate the complete backend service code with one click and easily deploy it to a Linux server, Docker, or Kubernetes.
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b>Efficiently Develop General-Purpose Services, from Definition to Implementation in One Step.</b> </summary>

> To build general-purpose `Web`, `gRPC`, `HTTP+gRPC`, or `gRPC Gateway` services, you only need to focus on these three steps:
> - Define database tables (SQL DDL);
> - Describe the API in a Protobuf file (Protobuf IDL);
> - Implement the business logic (supports a built-in AI assistant to automatically generate and merge business logic code).
>
> All basic code, including **CRUD APIs, service framework, and glue code**, is **automatically generated by Sponge**, allowing developers to focus on core business and comprehensively improve development efficiency.
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b>Supports Custom Templates for Flexible Expansion.</b> </summary>

> Sponge supports generating various types of code required for a project through custom templates, not limited to the `Go` language. Examples include `backend code`, `frontend code`, `test code`, `build and deployment scripts`, etc.
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b>Generate Code on a Web Page, Simple and Easy to Use.</b> </summary>

> Sponge provides code generation on a web page, avoiding complex command-line operations. Simply fill in the parameters on the page to generate code with one click.
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b>Sponge and AI Assistant Collaborative Development for Infrastructure Automation and Business Logic Intelligence.</b> </summary>

> Sponge, combined with its built-in AI assistants (DeepSeek, ChatGPT, Gemini), creates a complete, efficient, and intelligent development solution:
> - **Sponge**: Responsible for the automatic generation of infrastructure code, including `service framework`, `CRUD APIs`, `custom APIs (without business logic)`, etc., ensuring a unified and standardized architecture.
> - **AI Assistant**: Focuses on business logic implementation, assisting with tasks such as `database table design`, `Protobuf API definition`, and `business logic writing`, reducing repetitive work and improving R&D efficiency.
</details>

<br>

### Applicable Scenarios

Sponge is suitable for rapidly building various types of high-performance backend services, including the following scenarios:

- **Developing RESTful API services**
- **Building microservice projects**
- **Cloud-native project development**
- **Rapidly refactoring legacy projects**
- **As a starting point for Go beginners or as a best practice for teams**

Additionally, developers can generate various types of code to meet business needs through custom templates.

<br>

### Online Experience

Sponge provides an online experience for code generation: [**Code Generation**](https://go-sponge.com/en/ui).

> Note: If you need to run the downloaded service code locally, you must first complete the local installation of Sponge.

<br>

### Getting Started

1.  **Install Sponge**: Supports Windows/macOS/Linux/Docker, see the [**Sponge Installation Guide**](https://github.com/go-dev-frame/sponge/blob/main/assets/install-en.md).

2.  **Open the Code Generation UI Page**

    ```bash
    sponge run
    ```

    Access `http://localhost:24631` in your local browser to generate code.

3.  **Example: One-Click Generation of Complete Web Service Backend Code**

    </p>

    - Connect to the database, select table names.
    - Download Code: Get the complete code.
    - Generate Swagger Docs: `make docs`.
    - Run: `make run`.
    - Test: Access the Swagger documentation at `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html` in your browser to test the API.

### Components

Sponge has built-in support for over 30 common components in the Go ecosystem (used on demand), including mainstream technology stacks such as **Gin**, **gRPC**, **GORM**, **MongoDB**, **Redis**, **Kafka**, **DTM**, **WebSocket**, **Prometheus**, etc. [**View all components**](https://go-sponge.com/component/).

<br>

### Code Generation Engine

**Sponge** provides powerful code generation capabilities, supporting both `built-in templates` and `custom templates` to quickly generate the code required for your project. It also integrates an `AI assistant` to help generate business logic code.

1. Sponge generates a code framework based on built-in templates, as shown in the diagram below:

<p align="center">
<img width="1500px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-dev-frame/sponge/main/assets/sponge-framework.png">
</p>

<br>

2. Sponge generates a code framework based on custom templates, as shown in the diagram below:

<p align="center">
<img width="1200px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-dev-frame/sponge/main/assets/template-framework.png">
</p>

<br>

3. Sponge generates a business logic code framework based on functions and comments, as shown in the diagram below:

</p>

<br>

### Microservice framework

**Sponge** is a modern Go microservice framework that adopts a typical layered microservice architecture. It comes with a rich set of built-in service governance features, enabling developers to quickly build and maintain complex microservice systems. The structure of the framework is shown in the diagram below:

### Project Code Directory Structure

The project code directory structure created by sponge follows the [project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).

Sponge supports creating project code structures for `monolithic application in a single repository (monolith)`, `microservices in multiple repositories (multi-repo)`, and `microservices in a single repository (mono-repo)`.
